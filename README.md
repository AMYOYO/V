#Vigor

Once upon a time, I wrote the language V. After a couple months of working on it, the code got really messy and unorganized, to the point where working on it became a pain. So, I decided to rewrite it, with most of it being in vimscript rather than python.

This is the result. If you're looking at this repository, chances are you want [V](https://github.com/DJMcMayhem/V) instead. This repository won't be around for very long, and eventually I will merge it back into V.
